# Mission-to-Mars

##Summary

In Mission to Mars, we used web scrapping to get the titles and summary text from the Mars News website. We organized the scrapped data into a Python list. We also used web scrapping to get weather data on Mars. This data included an id, terrestrial date (date on Earth), sol (number of elapsed Martian Days), ls (solar longitude), month (Martian Month), min_temp (minimum temperature, in Celsius, of a single martian day) and pressure (the atmospheric pressure). With all of the data now available to us, we were able to organize the data into a dataframe and complete an analysis.
